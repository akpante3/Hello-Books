**Development**

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash

```

Refer to the [.env.sample](.env.sample) file for the required environment variables to get the application up and running.

## Installation

To run this application in development mode, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

When the development server is up and running (i.e displays a success message on your command line), you can test the server response by visiting the following endpoint using Postman:

`GET localhost:4000/`
